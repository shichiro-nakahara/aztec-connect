The Aztec netowrk allows DeFi users to save gas and participate anonymously in DeFi transactions. This functionality is currently being developed to work out of the box with leading DeFi protocols.

The rollup will support the following protocols at launch:

• Uniswap `ETH-DAI`  
• Uniswap `DAI-ETH`  
• Compound - `cDAI`

This functionality will be launched on test networks following a main-net burn in period in November, pre-audit. Users will be able to participate at their own risk with fix notional amounts invested in DeFi. After the protocol audit in Q1, the capital restriction will be lifted.

If you work for a protocol and wish to be included in the launch please reach out to joe@aztecprotocol.com.
