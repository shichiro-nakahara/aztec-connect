# Root Verifier Circuit
We use the notation of the Aztec Yellow Paper. In particular, $\text{BN254}$ is a curve defined over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$, $r$ is a prime on the order of $p$, and $\mathbb{G}_1$ is a subgroup of BN254 of order $r$.

### ◈ Circuit Description

This is a standard PLONK circuit that verifies a TurboPLONK root rollup proof.

### ◈ Circuit Inputs: Summary
The inputs for the root verifier circuit have the form

$$ \text{Root Verifier Inputs} = (\text{Public Inputs}, \text{Private Inputs}) \in \mathbb{F}_r^{17} \times \mathbb{F}_r^{16}.$$

### ◈ Public Inputs 

Like the root rollup circuit, the root verifier circuit has 17 public inputs. The first is a mod-$r$ SHA256 hash of broadcast data. This is, in fact, the same datum that appears as a public input to the root rollup circuit.

The remaining 16 public inputs encode the recursion output of the root verifier circuit, two points of $\mathbb{G}_1$. Each point consists of two $\mathbb{F}_p$ elements, which is in turn split into 4 68-bit limbs that are regarded as elements of $\mathbb{F}_r$. 

### ◈ Private Inputs
The root verifier receives no secret inputs. Therefore, since the broadcast data hash is made a public input, the only private inputs to the root verifier circuit are the 16 limbs in $\mathbb{F}_r$ that make up the recursive proof output of the root rollup circuit.

### ◈ Circuit Logic
The only constraints defining this circuit are generated by the recursion framework. Therefore, the constraints are roughly those described in the verifier's algorithm in the PLONK paper. More specifically, one should look at the VIP Edition of the paper which, at present, does not include the simplification proposed by Kev Wedderburn for smaller proof size (see IACR version 20210707:125953). Our circuit also does not contain this simplification.
