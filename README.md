### Barretenberg, an optimized elliptic curve library for the bn128 curve, and PLONK SNARK prover

**this code is highly experimental, use at your own risk!**  
  
The structured reference string contains monomials up to x^{2^20}. This SRS was generated locally and is for testing and development purposes only!


### Getting started  

```
git clone https://github.com/AztecProtocol/barretenberg  

mkdir build && cd build  
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

To run tests, in the /build directory run

```
test/barretenberg_tests
```

To run benchmarks, in the /build reictory run

```
test/barretenberg_bench
```

To compile without tests and benchmarks, use `cmake .. -DBARRETENBERG_TESTING=OFF`  

To select a test, run `./test/barretenberg_tests --gtest_filter=<test_filter>*`  

To build in debug mode: 

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"
cmake --build .
```

To build without x64 assembly:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DDISABLE_SHENANIGANS=ON
cmake --build .
```
